### Background(Why did I make this mod?)

Since version 1.20, Mojang has begun frequently updating the resource pack format version. From 1.6.1 to 1.19.4, the format version only increased from `1` to `13`, but by 1.21.8, it had already jumped to `64` ü§£ü§£ü§£. **This rapid ‚Äúversion number update‚Äù has left many resource packs without timely updates to the `pack.mcmeta` file‚Äôs declared supported versions, even though they are in fact compatible with newer versions of Minecraft.** As a result, players often face an entire page of ‚Äúincompatible‚Äù warnings on the resource pack screen.
